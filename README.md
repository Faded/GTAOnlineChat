# GTA Overlay Chat Client

A lightweight, transparent, in-game text chat overlay for **GTA V Online** (or any game), inspired by Rockstar's now removed in-game chat.

This project allows friends to run a standalone chat app that mimics GTA V's UI style without injecting into the game. It uses WebSockets for communication and runs externally as a transparent overlay. 

This project is in its most basic form and you are free to modify/use at your pleasure. More updates to follow on it and pull requests are taken in to consideration.

```
cd GTAChatServer
dotnet run
```
This will start the WebSocket server at:
```
ws://0.0.0.0:8181
```
You can add more server locations in ServerList.cs.

## üñ•Ô∏è 2. Run the Client
Open the GTATextOverlay project in Visual Studio and run.
```

```

```

These settings are saved to:
```
%APPDATA%\GTAChatOverlay\settings.ini
```

## ‚úç Customization
Add or Change Server IPs
Edit ServerList.cs:
```
public static readonly List<ServerInfo> Servers = new List<ServerInfo>
{
    new ServerInfo("Phoenix, AZ", "ws://<ip>:8181"),
    new ServerInfo("England, UK", "ws://<ip>:8181")
};
```

### Adjust Chat Style
Edit the AddChatMessage() method in MainWindow.xaml.cs:
